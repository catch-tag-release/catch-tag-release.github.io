Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit two prominent phenomena: attention sinks and large-norm (outlier) features. While these outlier features may not seem to have semantic relevance, they play a key role in model performance, compression, and streaming. Attention sinks, a type of attention pattern, are tokens that strongly attend to a few specific tokens—despite having no obvious connection to the model's task. In this work, we present a novel framework to explain the dynamics behind these behaviors using a ‘Catch, Tag, and Release’ mechanism. Through empirical investigation, we show how attention sinks leverage outlier features to sequentially “catch” tokens, “tag” them with a common perturbation, and “release” them back into the residual stream, where they are later retrieved. We argue that this mechanism arises naturally in simple tasks like averaging, helping to explain its prevalence in modern LLMs. Our findings also demonstrate that attention sinks can be fully captured in model parameters through low-rank matrices, offering insights into model compression techniques and confirming the effectiveness of low-rank approximations in preventing performance degradation.
